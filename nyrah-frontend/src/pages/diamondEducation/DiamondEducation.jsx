        <div className="font-poppins tracking-wider">Definition of a Diamond :</div>
        <div style={{paddingLeft:"1rem"}}>
          Diamonds are the hardest natural material on Earth, formed deep within
          the Earth's mantle over billions of years under intense pressure and
          heat. They are composed of pure carbon atoms arranged in a crystal
          lattice structure, which gives them their exceptional hardness and
          brilliance.
        </div>

        <div className="font-poppins tracking-wider">Why Diamonds Are Special :</div>
        <div style={{paddingLeft:"1rem"}}>
          Diamonds are unique because of their brilliance, durability, and
          symbolism. They have been treasured for centuries and are a symbol of
          love, commitment, and luxury.

        <div>
          When it comes to choosing the perfect diamond, you'll often hear the
          term "4 Cs." This is the standard that gemologists use to evaluate
          diamonds. Understanding each of these factors will help you make a
          well-informed decision.

        <div className="font-poppins tracking-wider">Cut</div>
        <div>
          <ul style={{paddingLeft:"1rem"}}>
            <li>
              The cut of a diamond is the most important factor in determining
              its beauty. A well-cut diamond willreflect light brilliantly,
              enhancing itssparkle.
            </li>
            <li>
              The cut includes the proportions, symmetry, and polish of the
              diamond.
            </li>
            <li> Diamond cut grades range from Excellent to Poor.</li>

        <div className="font-poppins tracking-wider">Color</div>
        <div>
          <ul style={{paddingLeft:"1rem"}}>
            <li>
              Diamonds come in a wide range of colors, but the rarest and most
              valuable diamonds are colorless.
            </li>
            <li>
              The color scale ranges from D (colorless) to Z (light yellow or
              brown).
            </li>
            <li>
              D, E, and F diamonds are considered colorless, G to J are
              near-colorless, and anything below K has noticeable color.

            <li>
              Carat weight measures the size of the diamond. While larger
              diamonds are rarer and more valuable, a diamond's size should not
              be the only consideration. Balance size with quality for the best
              value.
            </li>

          Diamonds come in various shapes, each with its unique appeal. The
