            HOW CAN I TELL IF A DIAMOND IS REAL?
          </h1>

          <div>
            Real diamonds can be tested through various methods, such as using a
            diamond tester, inspecting the stone's sparkle, or checking for
            sharp edges. It's always best to purchase from a trusted jeweler who
            offers certifications.

            DOES THE DIAMOND'S CARAT WEIGHT AFFECT ITS VALUE?
          </h1>

          <div>
            Yes, larger diamonds are rarer and more expensive. However, a
            well-cut smaller diamond may have better sparkle and value than a
            poorly cut larger diamond.
